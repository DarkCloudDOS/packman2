   컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

  In the last release of PACKMAN2 there were 2 files missing: XTNDMODE and
FONT8X16 that. The PMLE needed them to be compiled. I am sorry about that.
I am even sorrier that nobody seem to notice that.

    Why ?  Was the game that bad ?

  Luckly for you there was on dud who noticed it: its name is SERGE. You can
say thanks to him.
